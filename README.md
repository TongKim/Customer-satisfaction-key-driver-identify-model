# Customer Satisfaction Simulator

## Scope
The goal is to leverage analytical methods to identify key drivers of customer satisfaction across different restaurant brands. This project will develop targeted strategies for enhancing customer satisfaction and construct a simulator to estimate the impact of adjustments to these key drivers.

## Background
Recognizing the need for modern analytics in understanding customer satisfaction, I initiated this project as part of our R&D efforts to refresh and improve our analytical approach and strategy outcomes.

## Data Provision
Survey data, including responses on 25+ potential key satisfaction drivers and overall brand satisfaction, will be provided to support this analysis.
